      "Last 3 months getting too much negative feelings.\n",
      "Hi- discussion on my 6 months appraisal didn't happen even after my repeated reminders to my RM.I feel This was done intentionally to keep me in dark of the improvements required so that my final appraisal is negatively effected.On my further probing and followup- the discussion finally happened with my RM's Skip level in my RMs presence in March-19 end wherein I was generically told that my performance is not good without telling me the specific areas where the improvements are required.Moreover- i was clearly told that I will be rated A4 in my annual appraisal and we cannot move you to a different role also due to the same reason.This proved my doubt right of intentionally delaying my 6 months appraisal discussion.I strongly feel I have been targeted and forced to put my resignation.In my 11 yrs+ association with Airtel- I had never faced this humiliation and unprofessional behavior.All I would say that Airtel is loosing its reputation of an employee caring organization where presently the employee's carrier is totally dependent on his/her PR with the reporting manager and HR just being a mute spectator to this entire wrong practice.All this has finally forced me to put my resignation on 9th April-19 and I am presently serving the 2 months notice period as per process and valuing my long term relationship with Airtel.\n",

      "I think so as their is no time frame assigned by company to one -on-one conversations.For consistent and  meaningful communication there must create a culture of open communication with your team- with this we will go a long way to creating an environment where the best employees will be happy but initiative should be headed by HR.\n",

Since- it is a nascent business that was being developed- I was faced with a lot of business challenges for which I sought his help but received very little. Eventually- I stopped raising my concerns to him and learnt to find the solutions on my own. Only concerns that I continued to raise to him were manpower and logistical issues. As a result- due to his very low involvement in the business (apart from seeking daily gross adds targets vs achievements & manpower concerns)- there is hardly any feedback provided. Feedback then directly gets provided at the end of the year at the annual appraisal (which again might not be a well informed one due to the close to nil involvement).\n",
